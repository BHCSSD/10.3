**GRADED**

**IMPORTANT:** If you want to use images, you can download the dice images from the **images** folder. If not, you may use text dice (Unicode) from the **DiceRoll** lesson.

> **This assignment includes a visual design mark.**
> Choose your font and text size carefully. Align your components neatly. Make it look professional!

## **Game Overview**

The rules of this casino game are simple:

* The player rolls a die.
* The casino rolls a die.
* The higher number wins.
* If it’s a tie, the player wins big!

*(Tip: Review the **NumberGuess** example if you need a reminder on comparing random numbers.)*

## **Part 1: Setting Up Your File**

1. Download the six dice images (or Unicode dice symbols) from the provided folder.
2. Create **eight variables**:

   * Six for the dice images (or text dice) → `die1`, `die2`, …, `die6`
   * One for the **casino’s roll** → start at `0`
   * One for the **player’s roll** → start at `0`
3. In `setup()`:

   * Create a large canvas (at least 600×600 recommended).
4. In `draw()`:

   * Fill the background with a chosen color.

---

## **Part 2: Instructions Area**

1. Display **"Your Name’s Casino"** in a large, bold font.
2. Below that, in a smaller (and preferably different) font, add the game instructions:

   ```
   - Press the 'c' key to roll the Casino's die.
   - Press the 'p' key to roll your die (P for player).
   - Press the 'w' key to see if you're a winner.
   ```

> **Reminder:** `keyPressed()` should only update variables. Use `draw()` for all drawing and displaying.

---

## **Part 3: Images and Display Area**

1. Under the instructions, leave space to show each die image.
2. Add two text labels:

   * `Casino’s Roll:`
   * `Player’s Roll:`
3. Next to each label, draw a square placeholder (about 200×200 px) to display the dice.
4. At the start of the game, no dice should appear.

   * Use **two sets of 6-part if statements** to display the correct image *after* a roll is made.
   * Repeat this logic for both `casinoRoll` and `playerRoll`.

---

## **Part 4: Gameplay with `keyPressed()`**

> **Reminder:** `keyPressed()` updates variables only. All displaying happens inside `draw()`.

1. **When `c` is pressed** → Set `casinoRoll` to a random number (1–6).
2. **When `p` is pressed** → Set `playerRoll` to a random number (1–6).
3. **When `w` is pressed** → Use an if/else if/else structure to compare rolls:

   * If the casino’s number is higher → `"Casino wins!"`
   * If the player’s number is higher → `"You win!"`
   * If it’s a tie → `"JACKPOT! You win a million dollars!"`
4. Align your text properly, and make sure the layout looks clean and polished.

## **Final 10 (Challenge Extension)**

Add a **betting system**:

* Let the player bet points or money.
* Increase or decrease their total based on the outcome.
