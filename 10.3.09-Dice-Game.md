**GRADED**

**IMPORTANT**: If you want to use images, you can download the dice images from the **images** folder. If not, you may use text from the Diceroll lesson.

> **This assignment includes a visual design mark.**
> Choose font and text size thoughtfully. Align your components carefully. Make it look professional!



### **Game Overview**

The rules of this casino game are simple:

* The player rolls a die.
* The casino rolls a die.
* The higher number wins.
* If it’s a tie, the player wins big!

(You may want to review the **NumberGuess** example to remind yourself how to compare a random number to a user's input.)

---

## **Part 1: Setting Up Your File**

1. Download the six dice images from the provided folder.

2. Create the following **eight variables**:

   * Six for the dice images (or text dice) (`die1`, `die2`, etc.)
   * One for the **casino’s roll**, initially set to `0`
   * One for the **player’s roll**, initially set to `0`

3. In the `preload()` function:

   * Load your six dice images (if using images).

4. In the `setup()` function:

   * Create a large canvas window (at least 600×600 is recommended).

5. In the `draw()` function:

   * Set a background color to start with.

## **Part 2: Instructions Area**

1. Display **"Your Name’s Casino"** in a large, prominent font.
2. Below it, in a smaller font (and preferably a different font), add the instructions:

   ```
   - Press the `c` key to roll the Casino's die.
   - Press the `p` key to roll your die (P for player).
   - Press the `w` key to see if you're a winner.
   ```

> **Reminder**: You cannot use `text()` or `image()` inside `keyPressed()`, it should only update variables.

## **Part 3: Images and Display Area**

1. Beneath your instructions, reserve space for showing each die image.

2. Add two text labels:

   * `Casino's Roll:`
   * `Player's Roll:`

3. Next to each label, draw an empty square large enough to display a die (around 200×200 pixels).

4. When the game starts, no dice should be displayed yet. Use **two 6-part if statements** to display the correct image **after** a roll is made.
* Repeat this pattern for `playerRoll`.


## **Part 4: Gameplay Using `keyPressed()`**

> Reminder: `keyPressed()` only updates variables. All drawing must be done in `draw()`.

1. When the **`c` key** is pressed:

   * Set the **casinoRoll** to a random number between 1 and 6:

2. When the **`p` key** is pressed:

   * Do the same for the **playerRoll**.

3. When the **`w` key** is pressed:

   * Use a 3-part if/else if/else statement to display a result message:

     * If the casino’s number is higher: `"Casino wins!"`
     * If the player’s number is higher: `"You win!"`
     * If it’s a tie: `"JACKPOT! You win a million dollars!"`

4. Make sure your **text is well aligned**, and the layout looks clean and polished.


## **Final 10**

Add a **betting system** where the player can bet points or money. Adjust the winnings or losses based on the outcome.
