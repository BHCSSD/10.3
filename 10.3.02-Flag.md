## Introducing Flag Variable: 

A **flag variable** is a special kind of variable used to signal when something has happened. It's usually a `boolean` (`true` or `false`) and helps us **control when to run certain parts of the code**.

Think of it like a green or red light in your program, if the flag is `true`, go ahead! If it's `false`, stop and wait.

```javascript
let gameStarted = false // look this is the flag how simple. 

function mousePressed() {
  gameStarted = true; // set the flag to true when the user clicks
}// end mousepressed

function draw() {
  background(220);
  
  if (gameStarted) {
    text("Game is running!", 50, 50)
  } else {
    text("Click to start the game", 50, 50)
  }// end of if
}// end of draw
```


### Why Use Flag Variables?

Theyâ€™re helpful when:

* You only want something to run **once**, like showing a message after a form is complete.
* You want to **pause or resume** parts of your code.
* You need to wait for the **user to do something** before continuing (like clicking or entering input).
