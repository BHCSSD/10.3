## Model
```javascript
// Model: Handles the data

let sprite = {

} // this is called an object, it can store all the data for your sprite
```

## View
```javascript
// View: Handles the rendering
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
recMode(CENTER)
imageMode(CENTER)
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  rectMode(CENTER);
  // rect(x, y, 50, 50);
 
  
  // lets make an if() here for wrap around.
}
```

## Controller
```javascript
// Controller: Handles the user input
function keyPressed() {
  // Check for key presses and update the block's position
  if (key === 'w') { // W key
     // How do we move the square using grade 1 math?
  } // end W
  // if () { // S key
  
  // }
  // if () { // A key
  
  // }
  // if () { // D key
  
  // }
} // end key pressed

> ## ℹ️ Info Dump about Objects
> 
> An **object** is a way to store multiple related values in one variable.  
> Think of it as a little bundle of information about something, all grouped together.
>
> ```javascript
> let dog = {
>   name: "Buddy",
>   age: 3,
>   breed: "Labrador"
> };
> ```
>
> You can use dot notation to access or change the information:
>
> ```javascript
> text(dog.name, 100, 100); // Shows "Buddy"
> dog.age++;                // Now the dog is 4
> ```
>
> ### Why Use Objects?
> - Keeps all related info in one place  
> - Makes your code cleaner and more readable  
> - Useful for organizing characters, sprites, enemies, buttons, etc.

## Part 0 – The Setup

Create an **object** called `sprite = {}` in the global variables section.
  * you will need `cx`,`cy`,`speed` 

Set the window size to `300, 300`. <- why? so it is quicker for me to mark. 

---

## Part 1 – Basic Movement (80%)

1. Draw a small square on the screen (about 20x20).
   Don’t hardcode its position — instead, store the x and y values as variables inside your sprite object: `sprite.cx`, `sprite.cy`, etc.

2. Write code so the sprite can be moved using either:

   * The arrow keys (`keyCode === LEFT_ARROW`, `RIGHT_ARROW`, etc.)
   * The WASD keys (`key === "w"`, `key === "a"`, etc.)

3. Make the square wrap around the screen edges.
   For example, if it goes off the right edge, it should reappear on the left. Same for top and bottom.

   **Hint:**

   ```js
   if (sprite.cx is bigger than the width) {
     sprite.cx resets to 0
   }
   ```

4. At this point, your square should only move **once per keypress**.

5. Research how to make the square move **continuously** instead of one step at a time.
   (You can break MVC for this part if needed.)

---

## Next 10% – Add a Power-Up

1. Create a variable that controls how fast the rectangle moves.

2. When the user presses the `p` key, increase the speed:

   * After pressing `p`, the sprite should move farther with each arrow or WASD press.
   * You can choose to let `p` keep increasing the speed every time it’s pressed, **or** allow just one increase.

---

## Final 10% – Proximity Detection

1. Add a red rectangle across the **top** of the screen that is 40 pixels tall.
   (The top 40 pixels of the screen should be entirely red.)

2. If your sprite is touching this red box, display a warning message **inside the red zone**:

   > "Warning: Entering Enemy Territory. Proceed with caution."

3. Once everything else is complete, **replace the square** with:

   * A background image
   * A sprite image instead of a rectangle

---

## Challenge: Not for Marks
See if you can find code online to act as a timer.  Five seconds after you press the `p` key, your speed returns to normal.
  * you will probably need to use `millis()`
