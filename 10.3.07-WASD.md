## Model
```javascript
// Model: Handles the data

let sprite = {} // this is called an object, it can store all the data for your sprite
```

## View
```javascript
// View: Handles the rendering
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  sprite.cx = 200
// all the info regarding your sprite gets declared here.  sprite.something = ....
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  rectMode(CENTER);
  // rect(x, y, 50, 50);
  // How do we move the square using grade 1 math?
  
  // lets make an if() here for wrap around.
}
```

## Controller
```javascript
// Controller: Handles the user input
function keyPressed() {
  // Check for key presses and update the block's position
  if (key === 'w') { // W key
    
  } // end W
  // if () { // S key
  
  // }
  // if () { // A key
  
  // }
  // if () { // D key
  
  // }
} // end key pressed
```


## Part 0 - The Setup
make a object `sprite = {}` in the global variables. IN set up make a `sprite.speed = 5`Just note that `speed` is a sometimes reserved word in different languages,  `sprite.speed = 5` might not work. I sometimes use `vroom` if `size` doesnt work, same idea. 

Alter the window size to make it 300,300.

## Part 1 - Basic Movement (80%)
1. Draw a small square on the screen (about 20x20).  At the end of the project you use a small image either way, make instead of hard coding the cX and cY, make their values variables sprite.cx etc. 
2. Write code so that your user can your sprite both by using all 4 arrow keys and A-S-D-W.  
    - Remember:  `keyCode===LEFT_ARROW`
    - Remember:  `key === "w"`

3. Write code so the rectangle wraps the screen when it goes off the edges. 
    - Forget how?  think: if your square is off the window (700) go to the beginning (0)
    - format for if statements
      ```
      if(boolean question){
      your code goes here
      }
      ```
4. Your Square at this point should move only once per key click
5. Look into how to make the square continuously move instead of a bit at a time. For this, you can break MVC if you need.


## Next 10% - Add a power up
1. Create a variable that represents the speed at which the rectangle moves.
2. Then, when you press the `p` key, it should increase this speed.
    -  In other words, from that point on, each time you press an arrow key it should jump further.  You only need to press `p` once and you do not need to hold it down.
    -  You can allow multiple `p` presses to increase the speed each time, OR you can just have one-speed increase that lasts forever.


## Final 10% - Proximity Detection
1. Add a red rectangle that is 40 pixels high and covers the entire top of your screen (the top 40 should be all red).  
2. If your square is touching the red box, in the red box the following text should occur: “Warning: Entering the Enemy territory. Proceed with caution.”
3. Add a background image and a sprite instead of a square.**Do this only if everything else is done.** 

## Tough Challenge - Not for Marks
See if you can find code online to act as a timer.  Five seconds after you press the `p` key, your speed returns to normal.
