## This assignment should take you 1.5–2 classes at most.

Everyone knows your teacher is the epitome of *cool*, and you all aspire to be just like him. However, not everyone can reach that level.
Your mission is to create a 5-question test that determines **how cool your user actually is**.

You will keep track of a `score` variable that increases based on the user’s answers. At the end, you will give them a **coolness rating**.

---

## Part 0 – The Setup (20%)

**Save the file with the correct name.**

1. Create a `score` variable in the global variables area and set it equal to 0.
2. Create a `name` variable in the global variables area.
3. In the `setup()` function, use `window.prompt()` to ask the user for their name.

   * You **must** use the `name` variable somewhere in your program (like displaying it with the score).
   * This is the **only time** you are allowed to use `window.prompt()` in this assignment.
   * Do **not** use `window.prompt()` in `draw()` or `mousePressed()`. I know it’s tempting, but woe is the student who does...

## Part 1 – `draw()` & `keyPressed()` Functions (60%)

### `draw()` Function (20%)

1. Use `text()` to create a title for your Coolness Test.
2. Use `text()` to display all 5 multiple-choice questions on the screen **at all times**.
3. Each question must have **3 answer options**, with **unique keys** assigned per question:

   * Question 1: a, b, c
   * Question 2: d, e, f
   * Question 3: g, h, i
   * And so on...

```javascript
// Example:
Question 3: Which of the following is the best movie series?  
g) Star Wars   h) Marvel Universe   i) Hunger Games
```

4. Near the bottom of the screen, always show:

```javascript
"Petra, your coolness score is currently:  4"
```

Use the `name` and `score` variables to make this dynamic.

---

### `keyPressed()` Function (40%)

1. Use a long chain of `if`, `else if`, `else if` statements to check the user’s key presses.
* If they pick the correct answer their score goes up by 1
* Any wrong answers score goes down by 1
* If your user picks a really dumb answer, they mark goes down by ALOT
* If your user picks the ultimate bestest answer, they mark goes up by ALOT



---

## Part 2 – Pretty Up Your Test (10%)

1. Add at least **one image** **and** **one custom font** to your program.
2. Make your test visually appealing:

   * Use different `textSize()` values to organize your layout.
   * Make sure the **score** stands out.
3. Add icons or images for **each** question.
4. Clean up your code:

   * Use consistent indentation.
   * Add meaningful comments:

     * After closing braces `// end of if`, `// end draw()`, etc.
     * Before/after major code blocks.
   * Add spacing between code sections — just like paragraph breaks in LA class.

---

## Part 3 – Give Them a Rating (10%)

1. Add a line of text at the bottom:
   `"Press the 'Up arrow' key to test your score."`

2. Add another `else if` block in your `keyPressed()` function to handle the question mark key.

3. Create a **3-level rating system**:

   * Example:

     * `score >= 5`: DIAMOND coolness
     * `score >= 3`: SILVER coolness
     * else: COAL coolness
   * Half marks if this rating is shown on screen at all times.
   * **Full marks only** if it appears **only when the user presses `?`**.

4. Add one more key (you choose which) to **reset the score to 0** and allow the user to **take the test again**.

## Starter ... ish
```javaScript
// Oh scary.... no starter code. You can use your in-class examples for help. 
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}

function keyPressed(){
}
```
