## Something new: USER interactions with `keyPressed()`

In p5.js, the `keyPressed()` function runs **every time a key is pressed** on the keyboard. You can use this to check which key the user pressed and then **make your program respond** to it.

### Basic Format:

```javascript
function keyPressed() {
  if (key === "a") {
    // Do something when the 'a' key is pressed
  }//end of if
}//end of keyPressed
```

### Whatâ€™s Happening?

* `keyPressed()` is a **built-in function**, p5.js will automatically run it whenever the user presses a key.
* `key` is a **special variable** that stores the last key the user typed.
* You use **quotes** around letters or numbers because they are stored as **strings**.
* It is **case-sensitive**:
  `"a"` is **not** the same as `"A"`.
```javascript
function keyPressed() {
  if (key === "s"||key=="S") { // the || means OR
    shape="square"
  } else if (key === "b"|| key === "B") {
    shape="oval"
  }//end if
}// end keypress
```

### Bonus: Arrow Keys

If you want to check arrow keys, use `keyCode` instead:
```javascript
if (keyCode === LEFT_ARROW) {
  // do something
}
```

### Common Mistakes

* Forgetting to use `===` instead of `=`.
* Forgetting the quotation marks: `key === a` (wrong) vs. `key === "a"` (right).
* Using it inside `draw()` (not wrong, but not usually needed there).
