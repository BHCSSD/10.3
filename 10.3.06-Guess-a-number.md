## Introducing `while()` Loops

These are cousins to `for` loops.
`for` loops are great when you know **exactly how many times** you want a block of code to run.

`while` loops are great when you **don't know how many times** something should run, you just want it to **keep going until a condition is no longer true**.


### Basic Format:

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to repeat
}
```

As long as the `condition` is true, the loop will keep running.

```javascript
let counter = 0;

while (counter < 5) {
  print("Counting: " + counter);
  counter++;
}
```
---

### Infinite Loop Warning

Make sure something inside the loop **changes the condition**, or you’ll create an **infinite loop** that crashes your program.

```javascript
while (true) {
  print("Oops... this never ends.");
}
```
```javascript
while (x<5) {
  print("Oops... this never ends x never gets changed.")
}
```

### When Should You Use `while()`?

Use a `while` loop when:

* You're **waiting for user input**
* You're **looping until a random value appears**
* You **don’t know ahead of time** how many times to repeat


## starter
```javaScript
let compnum  = 20
let usernum = -1; // why is the user number set to -1 right away? 

function setup(){
  let compnum       //get the comp to pick a number between 0 and 100. 
 // usernum = window.prompt("pick  number between 1 and 100");  // this 1*window.prompt is a unique thing... 

  while(compnum!=usernum){ // while the comps number is not equal to your guess
    if(){ // fill out the () to see if usernum is less than compnum
      usernum = 1*window.prompt("guess higher");
    } //if 
    else{
      usernum = 1*window.prompt("guess lower");
      }//else
    }// end of while 
    window.alert("You win. the number was " + usernum)  // the + unsenum here combines the string "" with the number  in usernum
}//end setup

```
