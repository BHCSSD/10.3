## Requirements
Using 3 different `for` loops to do the following"
1. **Horizontal Line**:
   - Draw a line of emojis horizontally across the screen using a for loop.
2. **Vertical Line**:
   - Draw a line of emojis vertically down the screen using a for loop.
3. **Diagonal Line**:
   - Draw a line of emojis diagonally from one corner of the screen to the opposite corner using a for loop.
4. **Growing Emojis**:
   - Your emojis need to start small and grow bigger


## Experiments (not marked)
- Try making the font size change with every loop
- make the background colour always change 
- if you are brave try making a line that rotates
   - if you are really brave have a line of emojis follow your mouse.
