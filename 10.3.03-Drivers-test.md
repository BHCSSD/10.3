## Todo: 

Please do items 1-2 on your own. I will go through the next part with you. 
1. Load an emoji (or image) for a driver's school logo.
2. Add variables for `age` and `testScore`.
3. Use `window.prompt()` to ask the user for their age.
* **Do not** use `window.prompt()` inside `draw()` - woe be the human who does...

## Something new: USER interactions with `keyPressed()`**

In p5.js, the `keyPressed()` function runs **every time a key is pressed** on the keyboard. You can use this to check which key the user pressed and then **make your program respond** to it.

### Basic Format:

```javascript
function keyPressed() {
  if (key === "a") {
    // Do something when the 'a' key is pressed
  }//end of if
}//end of keyPressed
```

---

### What’s Happening?

* `keyPressed()` is a **built-in function**, p5.js will automatically run it whenever the user presses a key.
* `key` is a **special variable** that stores the last key the user typed.
* You use **quotes** around letters or numbers because they are stored as **strings**.
* It is **case-sensitive**:
  `"a"` is **not** the same as `"A"`.

```javascript
function keyPressed() {
  if (key === "a") {
    background(0, 255, 0)//green background
  } else if (key === "b") {
    background(0, 0, 255)//blue background
  }//end if
}// end keypress
```
---

### Bonus: Arrow Keys

If you want to check arrow keys, use `keyCode` instead:

```javascript
if (keyCode === LEFT_ARROW) {
  // do something
}
```

### Common Mistakes

* Forgetting to use `===` instead of `=`.
* Forgetting the quotation marks: `key === a` (wrong) vs. `key === "a"` (right).
* Using it inside `draw()` (not wrong, but not usually needed there).

---

##  Todo2:
   
4. Use an `if` statement:

   * If the age is 16, show that they can take the full test.
   * Else if age is above 14, allow them to take the learner’s test.
   * Else, they’re too young — display a message like “Hit the road, Jack.”
5. Add logic for test answers:

   * Use `key === '3'` to check if the user pressed the "3" key (note the quotes).
   * Same goes for `'r'`, `'g'`, `'y'`, etc. Use `keyCode` for arrow keys.

## Starter

### Model
The model will contain the variables and any data-related logic.

```javascript
// Model
let logo; // The work around for images... maybe
//2)
//

function preload() {
  // Load image for logo here. if no pictures no need for preload
  // logo = 
  // logo.hide();
}// end preloading of images and fonts
```

### View
This section handles visuals like `setup()` and `draw()`.

```javascript
// View
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
  background(100, 92, 80);
  textSize(18);
  fill(255, 255, 0);
}// end setup

function draw() {
  background(255, 0, 0);
  //image(logo, 50, 50, 100, 100);

  text("Your current score: " + testScore, 200, 380);
  text("How many colors are there on a traffic light?", 50, 250);
  text("Which color is in the middle of a traffic light? (type r, g, or y)", 50, 275);
  text("On what side of the road do they drive in Australia? (use the arrow keys)", 50, 300);
  text("Are kangaroos eligible for driver tests? (type m for yes, or n for no)", 50, 325);

  // 4) Logic for if statements to display eligibility message
    // if(){
    //     text("You are eligible for your full license." , 50, 200,);
    // } else if (){
    //     text("You are eligible for your Learner's license." , 50, 200,);
    // } else {
    //     text("You are not eligible. Beat it loser.", 50, 200);
    // }// end  of if

}// end draw
```

### Controller
This section handles interaction logic like checking answers and updating scores/variables.
```javascript
// Controller
function keyPressed() {
  // Logic to check answers and update test score
    // 3) 

  //5) answering the questions
   // if(){
    //    testScore++;
    //} else if (){ // set to y
    //    testScore++;       
    //} else if (){ // set to left arrow...  this is something new look up keyCode in p5 reference
    //    testScore++;
    //} else if(){ // set to n
    //    testScore++;
   // }// end of if
 
}// end keyPressed
```
