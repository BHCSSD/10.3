In this project, you need to make interactice artwork using `for` loops. Be creative, change things like color, size, shape, and stroke weight within the loops, and make your code interactive.

# p5.js Artwork Using For Loops - Rubric

| **TODO**                                                                                       | **Score Range** |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| - A single, basic for loop used without noticeable variations in visual elements. <br> - No variation in size, color, or shape, and no visible changes in each loop. | 50%             |
| - One or more visual elements change within the loop (e.g., color, stroke weight, transparency), but no variation across iterations. <br> - Basic variation in color, size, shape, or transparency. <br> - Minimal interactivity or dynamic changes. | 70%             |
| - Each loop iteration involves changes in color, stroke weight, or other visual elements, creating a dynamic and evolving pattern. <br> - Significant changes in color, size, shape, or transparency. <br> - The artwork evolves or reacts to interactions. | 80%             |
| - Nested loops are used to create intricate patterns, with multiple layers of variation (e.g., changing colors, shapes, or other parameters) that build complexity. <br> - Patterns are complex and visually engaging, with noticeable changes or movement in every loop iteration. <br> - Artwork responds creatively to user input, demonstrating strong interactivity. | 100%            |



## Additional Notes:
- **Creativity**: Demonstrates originality in the use of for loops to generate unique artwork.
- **Interactivity**: Code should allow user input or interaction to alter the visual output (e.g., mouse clicks, key presses, or real-time changes).
- **Manipulation of Loops**: Student shows a deep understanding of for loops, utilizing them to control various visual parameters such as shape, color, stroke weight, and transparency in creative ways.
